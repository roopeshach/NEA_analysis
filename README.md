## Electricity Demand Projection using LSTM and GRU

### Overview:
This notebook presents a comparative analysis between Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for projecting electricity demand. Both LSTM and GRU are types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are particularly suited for sequence prediction tasks.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis contains historical electricity demand data. The goal is to train models that can predict future electricity demand based on past data.

### Steps Covered:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Normalizing the data to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Defining the architecture of both LSTM and GRU models.
   - Specifying the input shape based on the data.
   - Compiling the models with appropriate optimizers and loss functions.

3. **Training**:
   - Training both models using the training dataset.
   - Implementing early stopping to monitor validation loss and prevent overfitting.
   - Tracking and saving the training and validation loss for each epoch.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating both models on the test set.
   - Calculating evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both models.
   - Visualizing the actual vs. predicted values.

5. **Results & Comparison**:
   - Comparing the performance metrics of the LSTM and GRU models.
   - Analyzing the training time and memory requirements for each model.
   - Assessing the responsiveness of each model to changes in hyperparameters.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Drawing conclusions based on the evaluation metrics, training time, and other observations.
   - Deciding which model (LSTM or GRU) is more suitable for the dataset and the specific problem.

### Key Findings:
- The LSTM model, with its increased complexity, showed slightly better performance on this dataset.
- Both LSTM and GRU models are powerful tools for sequence prediction tasks, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem, dataset characteristics, and computational constraints.

### Recommendations:
For users looking to replicate or extend this analysis, it's recommended to:
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- Consider using a larger dataset or incorporating additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore other advanced RNN architectures or hybrid models for further analysis.
